## [4.2.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1) (2026-02-07)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(offset): update cache immediately to prevent state reversion

Updates the internal `offsets_cache` synchronously when setting a new value.

- Ensures UI consistency between the optimistic update and the next full hardware sync.


### 📚 Documentation

* docs: refine debouncing documentation and reorder API usage notices

- Reordered README notices to prioritize high API usage explanation for better visibility.
- Updated 'Pending Command Tracking' and 'Debounced' descriptions to include button click interactions alongside sliders.
- Synchronized technical examples in DESIGN.md to reflect both UI button and slider interaction patterns.

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): Centralized entity architecture, advanced schedule metrics, and stabilized auto-quota management

This release introduces a major architectural leap, centralizing entity logic into a declarative system, enhancing schedule transparency through advanced metrics, and stabilizing the API quota management for both standard and proxy configurations.

- Declarative Mapping: Entities are now registered based on dynamic capability detection, ensuring a cleaner and more reliable integration footprint.
- Scoped Entity Factories: Dedicated helpers for Home, Zone, Device, and Bridge scopes (`create_home_sensor`, `create_zone_binary_sensor`, etc.).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Schedule Transparency:
- Next Schedule Change Monitoring: New sensors for tracking the timestamp, temperature, and mode of the next planned schedule event.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🛡️ STABILIZED AUTO-QUOTA & POLLING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Intelligent Interval Management:
- Configurable Minimum Floor: Introduced `min_interval_configured` to allow users to tune the floor of the adaptive polling system.
- Mode-Specific Minimums: Enforced safe floors (120s for Proxy, 20s for Standard) to prevent accidental API bans while maintaining maximum responsiveness.
- Budget-Aware Scaling: Polling intervals now proactively check budget availability for the minimum floor before attempting to scale up frequency.
- Interval Forensics: New sensors for `current_zone_interval`, `min_interval_configured`, and `min_interval_enforced` providing real-time visibility into the quota engine.

Refined Proxy Support:
- Proxy Url & Token Diagnostics: Enhanced visibility into proxy configuration with redacted token logging for security.
- Jitter Control: Dynamic jitter application when operating behind an API proxy to further reduce pattern-based detection.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🐛 CRITICAL FIXES & HARDENING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Open Window Detection:
- Timeout Preservation: Fixed a regression where the OWD timeout was not correctly preserved or restored during configuration changes.
- Preserved state in seconds for higher accuracy during property updates.

Overlay & AC Hardening:
- Centralized Payload Construction: Consolidated all overlay logic into `build_overlay_data`, ensuring consistent validation and OpenTherm awareness.
- AC Setting Stability: Refined handling of AC-specific fields (swing, fan speed) to prevent invalid payloads on partial updates.
- Robust Error Handling: Enhanced redacted logging for API interaction forensics.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### ✨ New Features

* feat(quota): dynamic reset detection, safety throttle, and reconnect logic

This release introduces a more robust and adaptive API quota management system:

- Dynamic API Reset Detection: Monitors remaining quota percentage during a safe window (12-13h Berlin) to detect and adapt to Tado's variable reset times.
- Persistent Reconnect Logic: Reduced the recovery check interval to 15 minutes (THROTTLE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL_S) for faster service resumption after outages.
- Safety Throttle: Automatically enforces a 5-minute safety interval and logs warnings if the API reports invalid limit data (<= 0).
- Enhanced Documentation: Updated README and DESIGN.md to reflect the new architecture and the 3000-call Proxy bypass advantage.
- Internal Refactoring: Optimized reset logic and stabilized data structures for more reliable quota tracking.

## [4.0.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1) (2026-01-31)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(core): proxy URL deletion, AttributeError fix

Proxy URL Deletion Fix:
- Changed from 'default' to 'suggested_value' in config schema (config_flow.py)
- Allows users to properly clear/delete the proxy URL field in settings
- Previously, 'default' would revert to old value when field was cleared
- Added explicit None handling in async_step_advanced and _async_finish_flow

AttributeError Protection:
- Added getattr() in supports_temperature() for non-OpenTherm systems (coordinator.py)
- Prevents crash: "AttributeError: 'types.SimpleNamespace' object has no attribute 'temperatures'"
- Enables dummy zones without temperature capabilities to work correctly

Hot Water Improvements:
- Added parse_schedule_temperature() helper for consistent parsing (parsers.py)
- Fixed auto_target_temperature to return null instead of omitting attribute (water_heater.py)
- Improves UI consistency when schedule is OFF

All functional logic remains unchanged.
