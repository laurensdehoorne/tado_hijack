## [5.0.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v5.0.0...v5.0.1) (2026-03-05)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(config_flow): quota interval and safety reserve not persisted on save

Both values were extracted from the wrong section in _flatten_section_data,
causing them to silently reset to defaults on reopen. Also fixes a float
cast issue for safety reserve and updates mypy hook to python3.14.


### 📚 Documentation

* docs(core): upgrade notice for v5.0.0 breaking changes

For users upgrading from v4.x directly to v5.0.1: v5.0.0 introduced
breaking changes that require attention before upgrading.

⚠️ IMPORTANT — READ BEFORE UPGRADING FROM v4.x
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Entity unique_id format changed:
- Old: {entry_id}_{suffix}
- New: {entry_id}_zone_{zone_id}_{suffix}
- Effect: ALL entities will be recreated on first start after upgrade
- Action: Delete and re-add the integration to avoid duplicate entities

Minimum Home Assistant version: 2024.11.0 (required for Matter support)

New mandatory setup step:
- Generation selection is now required during initial config
- Choose "Tado V2/V3 (Classic API)" or "Tado X (Matter Bridge)"
- Existing installs will be migrated automatically on first load

See full v5.0.0 release notes for details on new features (Tado X support,
V2 bridge, full cloud mode, multi-account, redundancy suppression).

* docs(quota): document adaptive reset window learning (shipped in v5.0.0)

This feature was included in v5.0.0 but omitted from the release notes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧠 ADAPTIVE QUOTA RESET WINDOW LEARNING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tado's daily API quota does not reset at a fixed time — the exact hour varies
per user account (observed: 7:30, 12:04, 14:xx, etc.). The integration now
learns your specific reset schedule automatically.

How it works (helpers/reset_window_tracker.py):
- Every detected quota reset is recorded with its timestamp
- Timestamps are normalized to X:30 to group resets within the same hour
- After 2 consecutive resets at the same hour → pattern is adopted ("learned")
- Single observation → stored but not adopted (may be anomaly)
- No pattern yet → fallback to default window (12:30)

Quota budget is then distributed relative to the learned reset time:
- Planning horizon: always minimum 20h ahead (conservative)
- Safety reserve: adaptively spread across the reset window
- Result: fewer wasted calls at end-of-day, smoother polling across 24h

Exposed via sensors (definitions.py):
- quota_reset_last: Last observed reset time
- quota_reset_next: Next expected reset time
- quota_reset_expected_window: Learned or default window
- quota_reset_pattern_confidence: "learned" / "single_observation" / "default"
- quota_reset_history_count: Number of resets in history (max 5)

State is persisted across HA restarts via helpers/storage.py.

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.3.0...v5.0.0) (2026-03-04)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Multiple breaking changes for migration:
- Entity unique_ids now include config entry_id AND zone_id prefix for multi-account support (format: {entry_id}_zone_{zone_id}_{suffix}). Entities will be recreated on upgrade. Recommended: Delete and re-add the integration to avoid duplicates.
- Minimum Home Assistant version is now 2024.11.0 for Matter support.

This release introduces complete Tado X support with Matter integration, V2 bridge compatibility, optional full cloud mode for all generations, enhanced multi-account support, and a modular generation-based architecture.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌟 TADO X GENERATION SUPPORT (IB02 BRIDGE X)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Complete Tado X Integration:
- Full support for Tado X hardware via hops.tado.com API
- Custom TadoXApi client (lib/tadox_api.py) with OAuth token reuse from tadoasync
- Pydantic models for type safety: TadoXZoneState, TadoXDevice, TadoXRoom
- Matter device integration and automatic room-to-entity mapping
- Generation-aware entity filtering and capabilities detection

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏗️ V2 BRIDGE SUPPORT & UNIFIED CLASSIC API
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

V2 Hardware Support:
- Added support for V2 Gateway bridges (GW) with ~20k API calls/day quota
- V2 and V3 consolidated into single GEN_CLASSIC constant (both use my.tado.com API)
- Only difference: V2 has no HomeKit, V3 has HomeKit support
- Backward compatibility migration for users upgrading from previous versions

Modular Architecture:
- helpers/tadov3/: Classic API handlers for V2 and V3 (mapper, executor, action_provider, parsers)
- Provider pattern: Generation-agnostic data fetching interface (UnifiedDataProvider)
- Executor pattern: Generation-specific command execution (executor_base.py, executor_unified.py)
- Clean separation: lib/ for API clients, helpers/tadov3|tadox/ for business logic

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
☁️ FULL CLOUD MODE (ALL GENERATIONS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Optional Cloud-Polling Climate Entities:
- New Full Cloud Mode toggle in config flow (default: false)
- Creates climate entities via cloud polling instead of HomeKit/Matter
- Supported for ALL generations (V2/V3/X) with generation-aware entity creation

Recommendations:
- ✅ V2 (GW): ONLY option for climate entities (~20k calls/day makes it viable)
- ⚠️ V3 (IB01/GW01): NOT recommended (1k calls/day reducing to 100, use HomeKit instead)
- ⚠️ Tado X (IB02): NOT recommended (1k calls/day reducing to 100, use Matter instead)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👥 ENHANCED MULTI-ACCOUNT SUPPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Improved Entity Namespacing:
- Extended entity unique_id format to include zone_id: {entry_id}_zone_{zone_id}_{suffix}
- Previous format: {entry_id}_{suffix} (insufficient for multi-account with identical zone IDs)
- Prevents collisions when multiple accounts have zones with same ID
- Device identifiers now include zone context for proper grouping
- Enables multiple Tado homes in single Home Assistant instance without conflicts

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚙️ CONFIG FLOW: GENERATION SELECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

New Setup Options:
- Generation selection: Classic (V2/V3) or Tado X (required during initial setup)
- Full Cloud Mode toggle for all generations (optional, default: false)
- fetch_extended_data toggle for initial poll optimization (optional, default: true)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Enhanced Service Target Support:
- Services now accept device entities (battery, child_lock, connection, etc.) as entity_id
- Automatic zone lookup via device serial number extraction from unique_id
- Previous: Only zone entities (climate, switch, sensor) worked as entity_id
- Now: ANY Tado entity (including TRV/device entities) can be used as target
- Example: set_mode with entity_id=binary_sensor.trv_battery now automatically resolves to zone

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔇 REDUNDANCY SUPPRESSION SYSTEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

API Quota Optimization:
- New redundancy checker (helpers/redundancy_checker.py)
- CONF_SUPPRESS_REDUNDANT_CALLS: Skip API calls when target state matches cached state
- CONF_SUPPRESS_REDUNDANT_BUTTONS: Also skip button actions when all zones already match target
- Saves quota on accidental double-clicks, repeated UI interactions, or automation retries
- Only sends API calls when actual change detected

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚙️ AUTO QUOTA: MINIMUM INTERVAL CONFIGURATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Configurable Minimum Polling Interval:
- MIN_AUTO_QUOTA_INTERVAL_S reduced from 20 to 5 seconds (absolute floor)
- DEFAULT_MIN_AUTO_QUOTA_INTERVAL_S remains at 20 seconds (recommended default)
- Users can now set more aggressive polling if needed (e.g., for testing or high-quota V2 bridges)
- Default remains safe at 20s to protect against accidental account throttling
- Range: 5s-12h (configurable in Advanced Settings)
- Proxy mode still enforces 120s minimum

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📚 COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

New Documentation:

- Removed redundant explanations and consolidated quota mentions

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): Tado X support, V2/V3 generation, full cloud mode, multi-account, and comprehensive overhaul


### 📚 Documentation

* docs(readme): reformat table of contents and add support section

## [4.3.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.2.3...v4.3.0) (2026-02-23)

### ✨ New Features

* feat(entity): flexible entity_id configuration and zone sensor naming fix

**Zone Sensor Naming Fix:**
The naming logic for zone sensors was inconsistent (using 'home_id' instead of 'zone_name'). This commit aligns sensors with other zone entities (e.g., resulting in 'sensor.zone_name_humidity' instead of 'sensor.tado_home_name_zone_id_humidity').

**Note on Migration:**
Existing installations will likely retain the old 'sensor.tado_home_name_XX' IDs due to Home Assistant's Entity Registry persistence. To apply the new naming scheme, deleting and re-adding the integration is recommended.

**Entity ID Configuration:**
- Introduced '_entity_id_prefix' and '_entity_id_include_context' class attributes for fine-grained control.
- Bridge entities now use 'tado_ib' prefix and exclude serial numbers from entity_id.
- Simplified entity_id generation logic.

**Config Flow Improvements:**
- Consolidated multi-step config flow into single page.
- All settings now visible and editable in one view.

Affected entities: All zone-level sensors (humidity, heating_power, next_schedule_*, etc.)

## [4.2.3](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.2.2...v4.2.3) (2026-02-23)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

Removes the 'brands' ignore flag from the HACS validation workflow.

- This change is required to pass the strict validation checks for submitting the integration to the official HACS Default Store.
- Ensures all brand assets (logos, icons) are correctly verified.

## [4.2.2](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.2.1...v4.2.2) (2026-02-07)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(device): update child lock cache immediately to prevent reversion

Synchronously updates the local `devices_meta` cache when setting Child Lock.

- Prevents the switch entity from reverting to its old state during the next fast poll cycle (which uses cached metadata).
- Mirrors the fix applied to temperature offsets for device-level properties.

## [4.2.1](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1) (2026-02-07)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* fix(offset): update cache immediately to prevent state reversion

Updates the internal `offsets_cache` synchronously when setting a new value.

- Prevents the entity from reverting to its old value during the next fast poll cycle (which relies on cached offsets).
- Ensures UI consistency between the optimistic update and the next full hardware sync.


### 📚 Documentation

* docs: refine debouncing documentation and reorder API usage notices

- Reordered README notices to prioritize high API usage explanation for better visibility.
- Updated 'Pending Command Tracking' and 'Debounced' descriptions to include button click interactions alongside sliders.
- Synchronized technical examples in DESIGN.md to reflect both UI button and slider interaction patterns.

Refined Proxy Support:
- Proxy Url & Token Diagnostics: Enhanced visibility into proxy configuration with redacted token logging for security.
- Jitter Control: Dynamic jitter application when operating behind an API proxy to further reduce pattern-based detection.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🐛 CRITICAL FIXES & HARDENING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Open Window Detection:
- Timeout Preservation: Fixed a regression where the OWD timeout was not correctly preserved or restored during configuration changes.
- Preserved state in seconds for higher accuracy during property updates.

Temperature Offset:
- Fixed offset sensor showing "Unknown" on startup.
- Lazy fetch on demand prevents unnecessary API calls.
- Cached offsets persist across integration reloads.

🔄 MIGRATION & BREAKING CHANGES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Config Entry Migration (Version 6):
- Auto-migration from v5 with default value population.
- New config keys: auto_api_quota_percent, reduced_polling_*, jitter_percent.
- Backwards-compatible fallbacks for missing keys.
- Migration runs silently on integration load.

Entity ID Changes:
- Internet Bridge sensors: Compact ID format (ib123 instead of ib-01-23-45-67).
- Unique ID stability ensures no entity duplication.
- Device info consolidation for cleaner device registry.

Removed Features:
- Old climate entities (replaced by split climate + water_heater).
- Manual quota calculation (replaced by Auto API Quota).
- Hardcoded polling intervals (replaced by adaptive system).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✨ QUALITY OF LIFE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

User Experience:
- Instant UI feedback via optimistic state (no toggle revert delay).
- Reduced API calls = faster quota preservation.
- Economy window allows zero-polling during sleep hours.
- Automatic mode for quota management (set-and-forget).
- Clear diagnostic sensors for troubleshooting.

Performance:
- 9108 lines of new code, 1022 lines removed (net +8086)
- Consolidated architectural overhaul into production-ready release.
- Thoroughly tested across extensive development cycle.
- Zero API waste with intelligent batching and caching.

Developer Experience:
- Modular manager architecture (easy to extend).
- Dummy zones for hardware-free testing.
- Comprehensive logging with redaction.
- Design documentation for future contributors.
- Marked dummy code with [DUMMY_HOOK] for easy cleanup.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Config entry migration required (auto-applied on load).
- Old climate entities removed (replaced by water_heater for hot water).
- Entity IDs for Internet Bridges changed to compact format.

UPGRADE NOTES:
- Recommended to review Auto API Quota settings in config.
- Check reduced polling window if using economy mode.
- Verify hot water zones appear as water_heater entities.
- Update automations referencing old climate entity IDs.

CREDITS:
This release represents an intense week of architectural work, forensic debugging, and real-world testing. Special thanks to @krisswiltshire30 for the collaboration and to the community members who helped test and validate the hot water entity. Your patience and detailed bug reports made this release possible.

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0) (2026-01-20)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **offset:** The 'sensor.temperature_offset' entities have been replaced by 'number.temperature_offset' to enable write access.

### ✨ New Features

* feat(offset): implement bi-directional temperature offset control

- Architecture: Integrated set_temperature_offset directly into TadoHijackClient (Inheritance over Monkeypatching).
- Controls: Replaced legacy read-only offset sensors with interactive 'number' entities (-10.0 to +10.0 in 0.1 steps).
- UI: Configured entities in BOX mode for direct numeric input and added full English/German translations.
- UX: Integrated with OptimisticManager and ApiManager for flicker-free, debounced (5s) API execution.
- Reliability: Implemented RestoreEntity support to preserve calibration states across Home Assistant restarts.
- Quality: Resolved mypy static analysis errors and optimized setup logic via Sourcery/Ruff.
- Docs: Updated documentation and removed redundant API information.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v1.1.0...v2.0.0) (2026-01-20)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** Complete architecture overhaul. Entities have been renamed and regrouped. Config flow and polling logic updated.

### ✨ New Features

* feat(core): architecture overhaul - smart batching, inheritance, homekit linking & controls

- Architecture: Migrated from monkey-patching to a clean inheritance model (TadoHijackClient).
- Device Mapping: Entities (Battery, Offset, Child Lock) are now mapped to physical devices (Valves) instead of Zones.
- HomeKit Linking: Automatically detects and links entities to existing HomeKit devices via Serial Number match.
- Smart Batching: Advanced TadoApiManager with CommandMerger logic merges multiple rapid commands into single Bulk API calls.
- Controls: Added Child Lock (Switch), Boost All Zones (Button), Turn Off All Zones (Button).
- Security: Implemented centralized, strict PII redaction (TadoRedactionFilter) for logs (strings & objects).
- Performance: Decoupled RateLimitManager, reduced default polling to 30m, and added configurable debounce (default 5s).
- Logic: Centralized OptimisticManager, TadoRequestHandler, AuthManager, and CommandMerger for robust and modular API handling.
- Documentation: Complete README overhaul with better structure and detailed API consumption table.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/banter240/tado_hijack/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) (2026-01-17)
