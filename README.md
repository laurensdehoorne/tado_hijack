<br>

**The only Tado integration that survives when they cut your API to 100 calls/day.**

<br>

### 🧠 **Auto-Adaptive. Zero-Configuration. Bulletproof.**

While other integrations **die** when Tado slashes API limits, Tado Hijack **just adapts**. Our Auto Quota system intelligently recalculates your polling speed in real-time — whether Tado gives you 1,000 calls or 100, **your smart home keeps running**.

</div>

<br>

---

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **High API Usage is Expected (And Good!):**
> **You might see 800-1,500 API calls per day.** This is **completely normal** and exactly how Auto Quota is designed to work!
>
> - Tado currently gives you **1,000 calls/day** — we use them efficiently for responsive updates (every ~90s)
> - **If Tado cuts you to 100 calls/day**, Auto Quota **automatically slows down** to maintain optimal performance
>
> **TL;DR:** High usage now = fast updates. Low quota later = automatic slowdown. This is the whole point of Auto Quota! 🚀

## 🔥 **Why Tado Hijack?**

<br>

Tado is forcing you into a subscription by choking the "free" API — **already cut from 20k → 5k → 1k calls/day**, with **100 calls/day planned next**. Most integrations will simply stop working. **We engineered a different solution.**

<br>

### **The Tado Hijack Advantage:**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What Tado Hijack Does (and Doesn't Do):**
>
> **Temperature Control (Climate Entities):**
> - **Default Mode:** Use **HomeKit Device** (v3) or **Matter** (Tado X) for local temperature control
> - **Full Cloud Mode (All Generations):** Optional cloud-polling climate entities
>   - ⚠️ **Recommended for V2 bridges (GW)** which lack HomeKit/Matter support
>   - V2's 20k calls/day makes cloud polling viable
>   - V3/X can also use cloud mode, but HomeKit/Matter is preferred (1k calls/day, reducing to 100 soon)
>
> **What Tado Hijack Adds:**
> - Cloud-only features: Schedules, Hot Water, AC Pro, QuickActions
> - Hardware settings: Child Lock, Temperature Offset, Battery status
> - API quota management and intelligent polling
> - **Device Unification:** Injects these features into your existing HomeKit devices (V3 only - Matter lacks serial numbers for linking)
> - **V2 Support:** First integration supporting legacy GW bridges via Full Cloud Mode
>
> **TL;DR:** HomeKit/Matter = Temperature Control | Tado Hijack = Cloud Features + Smarts<br>
> **V2 Bridges:** Enable Full Cloud Mode for basic climate control (API-intensive!)

<br>

- **🧠 Fully Autonomous:** Set it once, forget forever. Auto Quota adapts to **any** API limit Tado throws at you (1k, 100 — doesn't matter).
- **💎 Extreme Batching:** 10 commands across 10 rooms? **Still only 1 API call.** We fuse everything.
- **🛡️ Threshold Protection:** Reserve quota exclusively for your automations. Background polling **never** touches this buffer.
- **🌙 Night-Savings Reinvestment:** Sleep 23:00-07:00? We pause polling and reinvest those saved calls into lightning-fast daytime updates.
- **🔗 Device Unification (V3/HomeKit only):** We don't replace your HomeKit devices — we **upgrade** them with cloud power-features (Hot Water, AC Pro, Schedules) in one unified device. _Note: Matter (Tado X) doesn't expose serial numbers, so features appear as separate entities._
- **🌟 Universal Hardware Support:** First integration supporting **V2 (GW bridges), V3 Classic, AND Tado X** in one unified architecture with generation-aware features.
- **🕒 Dynamic Reset Detection:** Monitors Tado's 12-13h reset window and auto-detects quota refresh by tracking percentage jumps.
- **📡 Real-Time Quota Transparency:** See your remaining "API Gold" live. Know exactly when Tado tries to silence you.

<br>

**Bottom Line:** Other integrations require constant manual adjustments, feature sacrifices, or just break entirely. **Tado Hijack is engineered to outlast Tado's hostility.**

<br>

## Key Highlights

<br>

### Extreme Batching Technology

<br>

While other integrations waste your precious API quota for every tiny interaction, Tado Hijack features **Deep Command Merging**. We collect multiple actions and fuse them into a single, highly efficient bulk request.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Maximum Fusion Scenario:**
> Triggering a "Party Scene": **AC Living Room** (Temp + Fan + Swing) + **AC Kitchen** (Temp + Fan) + **Hot Water** (ON).
>
> ❌ **Standard Integrations:** 6-8 API calls (Half your hourly quota gone).
> ✅ **Tado Hijack:** **1 single API call** for everything.
>
> _Note: This works within your configurable **Debounce Window**. Every action is automatically fused._

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Universal Batching:** This applies to manual dashboard interactions AND automated service calls (like `set_mode`). 10 changes at once? **Still only 1 API call.**

<br>

---

<br>

### The Local "Missing Link"

<br>

**We don't replace local control. We enhance it.**

**For V3 (HomeKit):** Tado Hijack detects your existing HomeKit devices and **injects** cloud-only features directly into them — creating one unified device with both local control and cloud power-features.

**For Tado X (Matter):** Matter doesn't expose serial numbers for device linking, so Tado Hijack features appear as separate entities alongside your Matter climate entities.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hybrid Architecture:**
> This integration is designed to work **alongside** native local control:
>
> - **Tado v3 Classic:** Works with HomeKit Device integration (provides `climate` entity for local temperature control)
> - **Tado X:** Works with Matter integration (provides `climate` entity for local temperature control)
> - **Tado Hijack:** Provides the "Missing Links" for **both generations** (Schedules, Hot Water, AC Modes, Hardware Settings)
>   - **V3 Bonus:** Device Unification (features injected into HomeKit devices)
>
> _Note: **Full Cloud Mode** provides climate entities via API polling but consumes API quota for temperature changes. See [Full Cloud Mode](#full-cloud-mode-all-generations) for details._

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **No Redundancy (Default Mode):** By default, Tado Hijack does **not** create climate entities, as local protocols (HomeKit/Matter) already handle temperature control efficiently. We focus on cloud-only features: **Schedules, Hot Water, AC Modes, Hardware Settings**.
>
> **Full Cloud Mode:** Optionally enables cloud-polling climate entities, **but consumes API quota** for every temperature change. Only recommended for V2 bridges (20k calls/day) or users without HomeKit/Matter access.

<br>

<br>

### Unleashed Features (Non-HomeKit)

<br>

We bring back the controls Tado "forgot" to give you:

- **🚿 Professional Hot Water Platform:** Native `water_heater` entity with standardized `auto`, `heat`, and `off` modes. Full Pre-Validation ensures you never send invalid configurations.
- **❄️ AC Pro Features:** Precise Fan Speed and Swing (Horizontal/Vertical) selection.
- **📅 Schedule Transparency:** View the target temperature of your active Smart Schedule directly via the `auto_target_temperature` attribute while in `auto` mode (available for AC and Hot Water).
- **🕵️‍♂️ Expert-Level Error Capturing:** No more generic "422" errors. Tado Hijack captures the actual response body from Tado's API (e.g. _"temperature must not be null"_), giving you and the community precise feedback for troubleshooting.
- **🔥 Valve Opening Insight:** View the percentage of how far your valves are open (updated during state polls).
- **🔋 Real Battery Status:** Don't guess; see the actual health of every valve.
- **🌡️ Temperature Offset:** Interactive calibration for your thermostats.
- **✨ Dazzle Mode:** Control the display behavior of your V3+ hardware.
- **🏠 Presence Lock:** Force Home/Away modes regardless of what Tado thinks.
- **🔥 Dynamic Presence-Aware Overlay:** Set temperatures specifically for the current presence state — an exclusive feature that automatically resets once your home presence changes.
- **🔓 Rate Limit Bypass:** Support for local [tado-api-proxy](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy).

<br>

---

<br>

### State Integrity & Robustness

<br>

Tado Hijack implements enterprise-grade state management to ensure your settings never get lost or overwritten:

- **💾 State Memory:** AC fan speed, swing positions, and target temperatures survive Home Assistant restarts. No more "reset to default" frustration.
- **🔒 Field Locking:** Prevents concurrent API calls from overwriting each other. Change fan speed, then swing, then temperature in rapid succession — all settings are preserved.
- **🎯 Pending Command Tracking:** Rapidly clicking temperature buttons (+/-) or dragging a slider? Multiple UI events collapse into **1 API call** with the final value. Zero waste, zero duplicates.
- **⏮️ Rollback on Error:** If an API call fails (e.g., invalid payload), the UI automatically reverts to the previous state with a clear error message. No "ghost states" where the UI lies about what's active.
- **🧵 Thread-Safe Queue:** All write operations pass through a single serialized queue. Automations, dashboard changes, and service calls never conflict or race.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **tado-api-proxy TL;DR:**
> The proxy acts as a local cache and authentication handler. It allows you to use your integration without being strictly bound to Tado's cloud limits.
>
> 1. Run the [Docker Container](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy#docker-setup).
> 2. Set your `API Proxy URL` in Hijack Options (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:8080`).
> 3. Enjoy unlimited local-like polling (safety floor still applies).

## API Consumption Strategy

<br>

Tado's API limits are restrictive. That's why Tado Hijack uses a **Zero-Waste Policy**.

<br>

### API Consumption Table

<br>

| Action              |  Cost  | Frequency     | Description                              | Detailed API Calls                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :----: | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zone Poll**       | **1**  | Adaptive      | HVAC, Valve %, Humidity.                 | `GET /homes/{id}/zoneStates`                                                           |
| **Presence Poll**   | **1**  | 12h (Default) | Home/Away presence state.                | `GET /homes/{id}/state`                                                                |
| **Hardware Sync**   | **2+** | 24h (Default) | Syncs battery, firmware and device list. | `GET /homes/{id}/zones`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/devices`<br>`GET /zones/{id}/capabilities` |
| **Refresh Zones**   | **2**  | On Demand     | Updates zone/device metadata.            | `GET /homes/{id}/zones`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/devices`                                   |
| **Refresh Offsets** | **1–N**  | On Demand  | Fetches device offsets. 1 call with `entity_id`, N without. | `GET /devices/{s}/temperatureOffset` (×1 or ×N)                                  |
| **Refresh Away**    | **1–M**  | On Demand  | Fetches zone away temps. 1 call with `entity_id`, M without. | `GET /zones/{z}/awayConfiguration` (×1 or ×M)                                   |
| **Zone Overlay**    | **1**  | On Demand     | **Fused:** All zone changes in 1 call.   | `POST /homes/{id}/overlay`                                                             |
| **Home/Away**       | **1**  | On Demand     | Force presence lock.                     | `PUT /homes/{id}/presenceLock`                                                         |

_Note: Endpoints shown are v3 API. Tado X uses different endpoints (Hops API) but similar polling logic. See [Generation Support](#generation-support-v3-classic--tado-x) for differences._

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **API Optimization Features:**
>
> - **Zero Waste Writes:** Commands don't trigger a poll. We use Local State Patching to update the UI instantly without confirmation calls.
> - **Throttled Mode:** When quota runs low, periodic polling auto-disables to preserve quota for your automations.
> - **Granular Refresh:** Hardware configs (Offsets, Away Temps) are never fetched automatically — only on-demand when you need them.

<br>

### Auto API Quota & Economy Window

<br>

**This is where Tado Hijack becomes truly unstoppable.**

<br>

While other integrations die when Tado cuts their API limits, **we simply adapt**. Auto API Quota is a **fully autonomous, self-optimizing system** that intelligently distributes your precious API calls across the day — no matter what Tado throws at you.

<br>

#### 🧠 **Zero-Touch Intelligence**

Once enabled, you **never need to touch your polling intervals again**. The system:

- **🔄 Adapts to ANY Limit:** Tado reduces your quota from 20k → 5k → 1k → 100? **We don't care.** The brain recalculates instantly and adjusts your polling speed to match. Your smart home keeps running.
- **🎯 Threshold Protection:** You configure a "Throttle Threshold" (default: 20 calls). This quota is **reserved** exclusively for your automations, scripts, and manual app usage. The periodic background polling **never** touches this buffer — ensuring your automations always work, even when quota runs low.
- **📉 Dynamic Slowdown:** If you exceed the threshold (e.g., heavy automation day), Auto Quota doesn't panic. It **automatically slows down** background polling for the rest of the day to compensate, preventing you from hitting the hard limit.
- **🌙 Night-Savings Reinvestment:** Configure an Economy Window (e.g., 23:00 - 07:00) where polling slows to a crawl (or stops entirely with Interval 0). The system calculates the **exact API savings** from your sleep hours and **reinvests** them into faster updates during your active Performance Phase.
- **🕒 Adaptive Reset Learning:** Learns YOUR specific reset time through pattern detection. Tado's quota resets vary by user (7:30, 12:04, etc.). After observing 2+ resets at the same hour, the system adapts to your schedule and optimizes quota distribution accordingly. Always plans minimum 20h ahead for conservative budgeting.
- **🛡️ Works with Proxy Too:** Even if you bypass Tado's cloud limits using the API Proxy, Auto Quota still optimizes your polling patterns for maximum efficiency and account safety.

<br>

#### 🚀 **The Result: True "Set and Forget"**

Other integrations require constant babysitting:

- 💀 **Other Devs:** Hardcode new intervals when Tado changes limits. Users must manually update configurations or reinstall.
- 💀 **Other Users:** Constantly adjust polling intervals, disable features, or lose functionality when quota drops.

**Tado Hijack:** ✅ **Just works.** Forever. Regardless of what Tado does.

<br>

#### 🎯 **Real-World Scenarios**

| Scenario                                      | Other Integrations                                               | **Tado Hijack (Auto Quota)**                                             |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tado cuts limit further to 100 calls**      | 💀 Integration dies or polls once per day. Automations fail.     | ✅ Auto-adjusts polling speed. Threshold ensures automations still work. |
| **Heavy automation day** (50+ external calls) | 💀 Quota exhausted by noon. No updates for rest of day.          | ✅ Detects excess usage, slows background polling to compensate.         |
| **Using API Proxy** (3000 calls/day)          | ⚠️ Hardcoded to slow intervals, wasting available quota.         | ✅ Maximizes proxy quota with optimized high-speed polling.              |
| **Night time** (23:00 - 07:00)                | ⚠️ Keeps polling at same rate, wasting quota while you sleep.    | ✅ Slows to 1h (or pauses). Saves 8+ hours of calls for daytime.         |

<br>

#### ⚙️ **How It Works**

<br>

**The Math behind the Intelligence:**

The system distributes your daily quota budget across the full day, and continuously recalculates how much is left for polling:

```
# 1. Daily polling budget based on your total limit
DAILY_CEILING = (Limit - Background_24h - Throttle_Threshold) × Auto_API_Quota_%

# 2. Effective threshold rises with actual external usage above the configured floor
INFERRED_EXTERNAL   = max(0, Consumed - Background_Consumed - Expected_Polling)
EFFECTIVE_THRESHOLD = max(Throttle_Threshold, INFERRED_EXTERNAL)
DAILY_CEILING       = (Limit - Background_24h - EFFECTIVE_THRESHOLD) × Auto_API_Quota_%

# 3. How much of that budget is still available
PLANNED_BUDGET = DAILY_CEILING - (Consumed - Background_Consumed)

# 4. Capped against what is actually remaining in your account
AVAILABLE_NOW = Remaining - Throttle_Threshold - Future_Background

# 5. Final budget for the rest of the day
FINAL_BUDGET = max(0, min(PLANNED_BUDGET, AVAILABLE_NOW) - Safety_Reserve)
```

> **💡 Adaptive Reset Window Learning:**
> Tado's quota reset time **varies by user** (some get 7:30 AM, others 12:04 PM). The system learns YOUR specific reset schedule by observing reset patterns:
> - **First reset:** Noted, system stays conservative (assumes 12:30 default)
> - **2+ resets at same hour:** Pattern learned! System adapts to your schedule (e.g., 7:30 → normalized to 7:30)
> - **Planning horizon:** Always plans minimum **20 hours ahead** to prevent quota burning
> - **Normalization:** All resets in the same hour (e.g., 7:03, 7:35, 7:58) are normalized to X:30 for pattern grouping
>
> The safety reserve (default: 2 calls) bridges uncertainty during the reset window to keep polling active even when budget runs out.

<br>

**Adaptive Behavior & Safety:**

Instead of a static timer, your polling interval breathes with your quota and your life:

- **Performance Phase:** While you are awake, updates arrive as fast as every **20s** (or **120s** if using a proxy).
- **Economy Phase:** During your sleep window, the integration drops to a slow heartbeat (e.g., 1h) or pauses completely, saving every single call for the next morning.
- **🛡️ Safety Floor (Minimum Polling):** To protect your Tado account, we enforce minimum intervals:
  - **Standard:** Minimum **5 seconds** per update (configurable 5s-12h in Advanced Settings, default: 20s).
  - **API Proxy:** Minimum **120 seconds** per update (configurable 120s-12h in Advanced Settings).
  - _Note: These limits apply even if your budget allows for faster updates._

### Batching Capability Matrix

<br>

Not all API calls are created equal. Tado Hijack optimizes everything, but physics (and the Tado API) sets limits.

<br>

| Action Type       | Examples                                                            | Strategy      | API Cost                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **State Control** | Target Temp, Turn Off All, Resume Schedule, Hot Water Power, AC Fan | **FUSED**     | **1 Call Total** (regardless of zone count)   |
| **Global Mode**   | Home/Away Presence                                                  | **DIRECT**    | **1 Call**                                    |
| **Zone Config**   | Early Start, Open Window, Dazzle Mode                               | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Zone** (Sequentially executed)   |
| **Device Config** | Child Lock, Temperature Offset                                      | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Device** (Sequentially executed) |

<br>

> **Fused (True Batching):**
> Multiple actions across multiple zones are merged into a **single** API request.
> _Example: Turning off 10 rooms at once = **1 API Call**._
>
> **Debounced (Rapid Update Protection):**
> Prevents spamming the API during rapid interactions (like clicking buttons or dragging sliders). Only the final value is sent.
> _Example: Rapidly clicking a temperature button or dragging a slider from 18°C to 22°C generates multiple events, but only **1 API Call** is sent._

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Exceptions:** Device configs (Child Lock, Offset) require individual API calls per device. See [Services](#services) table for complete API impact breakdown.

## Architecture

<br>

### Physical Device Mapping & Resolution

<br>

Unlike other integrations that group everything by "Zone", Tado Hijack maps entities to their **physical devices** (Valves/Thermostats).

- **Matched via Serial Number:** Automatic injection into existing HomeKit devices.
- **EntityResolver:** A specialized engine that deep-scans the Home Assistant registry to perfectly link HomeKit climate entities with Tado's cloud logical zones.
- **No HomeKit?** We create dedicated devices containing **only** the cloud features (Battery, Offset, Child Lock, etc.), but **no** temperature control.

<br>

### Robustness & Security

<br>

- **JIT Poll Planning:** Uses high-precision timestamps instead of simple flags to decide exactly when a data fetch is required (Zero-Waste).
- **Monkey-Patching Utilities:** We actively fix `tadoasync` library limitations at runtime, including robust deserialization for tricky cloud states (like `nextTimeBlock` null errors).
- **Custom Client Layer:** Extended underlying library via inheritance to handle API communication reliably and fix common deserialization errors.
- **Safety Throttle (Anti-Spam):** If the Tado API reports an invalid limit (e.g., `<= 0` during outages), the integration automatically throttles to a **5-minute safety interval** and logs a warning to prevent rapid re-polling.
- **Authenticated Proxy Support:** Fully supports path-based authentication for the API Proxy, ensuring your external communication remains secure and private.
- **Persistent Reconnect & Recovery:** When the API quota is exhausted (throttled), the system performs a recovery check every **15 minutes** (reduced from 1h) to ensure immediate resumption of services as soon as the API becomes available or the quota resets.
- **Privacy by Design:** All standard logs and diagnostic reports are automatically redacted. Sensitive data is stripped before any output is generated. (See [Expert-Level Diagnostics](#expert-level-diagnostics) for details).
- **🎭 Pattern Obfuscation:** Multi-Level Jitter (Poll & Call) breaks temporal correlation between Home Assistant triggers and API requests to avoid pattern-based throttling (Proxy only).

## Installation

<br>

### Via HACS (Recommended)

<br>

Tado Hijack is now an **official HACS integration**! No custom repository needed.

1. Open **HACS** -> **Integrations**.
2. Search for **"Tado Hijack"** and click **Download**.
3. **Restart Home Assistant**.
4. Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Add Integration** -> Search for **"Tado Hijack"**.
5. **Select your hardware generation** (determined by your physical Tado bridge):
   - **Tado v3 Classic** - If you own an **IB01** or **GW01** bridge (black square box)
   - **Tado X** - If you own a **Bridge X (IB02)** (newer Matter-based system)

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hardware Generation:**
> Select your generation during setup based on your physical bridge: IB01/GW01 = **v3 Classic**, IB02 = **Tado X**. If unsure, choose v3 Classic (most common). See [Generation Support](#generation-support-v3-classic--tado-x) for feature differences.

## Configuration

<br>

| Option                             | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status Polling**                 | `30m`     | Base interval for room states. **Note:** Dynamically overridden by _Auto API Quota_ when enabled; serves as fallback during throttling or budget exhaustion.                                                                                               |
| **Presence Polling**               | `12h`     | Interval for Home/Away state. High interval saves mass quota. (1 API call)                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Auto API Quota**                 | `80%`     | Target X% of FREE quota. **Note:** The official API is currently limited to **1,000 calls/day**. Using the **API Proxy** bypasses this limitation, granting **3,000 calls per account**. Uses a weighted profile to prioritize performance hours.          |
| **Reduced Polling Active**         | `Off`     | Enable the time-based weighted polling profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Reduced Polling Start**          | `22:00`   | Start time for the economy window (e.g. when you sleep).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Reduced Polling End**            | `07:00`   | End time for the economy window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Reduced Polling Interval**       | `3600s`   | Polling interval during the economy window. Set to **0** to pause polling entirely.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Hardware Sync**                  | `86400s`  | Interval for battery, firmware and device metadata. Set to 0 for initial load only.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Offset Update**                  | `0` (Off) | Interval for temperature offsets. Costs 1 API call per valve.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Min Polling Window**             | `20s`     | **Performance Floor:** The absolute fastest speed Auto Quota will poll (5s-12h, default: 20s).                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Debounce Time**                  | `5s`      | **Batching Window:** Fuses actions into single calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Refresh After Resume**           | `On`      | Auto-refresh target temperature/state after resume schedule (HVAC AUTO). Required because schedules are Tado cloud-side. Uses 1s grace period to merge multiple resumes. Costs 1 API call.                                                                 |
| **Throttle Threshold**             | `20`      | **External Protection Buffer:** Reserve N calls for everything outside of Hijack's periodic background polling (External Automations, Scripts, Manual App use). Polling stops when remaining quota hits this floor to ensure your automations never stall. |
| **Quota Safety Reserve**           | `2`       | **Reset Window Bridge:** API calls reserved from quota percentage for the reset window (12:00-13:00 Berlin). Distributed evenly during the window to bridge uncertainty when reset time varies (e.g., 12:05 vs 12:30). Set to 0 to disable (not recommended). |
| **Disable Polling When Throttled** | `Off`     | Stop periodic polling entirely when throttled.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **API Proxy URL**                  | `None`    | **Advanced:** URL of local `tado-api-proxy` workaround.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **API Proxy Token**                | `None`    | **Security:** Authentication token for your proxy. Injected into the path (`/token/api/v2`).                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Call Jitter**                    | `Off`     | **Anti-Ban Protection:** Adds random delays before API calls to obfuscate automation patterns (Proxy only).                                                                                                                                                |
| **Jitter Strength**                | `10%`     | The percentage of random variation applied to intervals and delays (Proxy only).                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Log Level**                      | `INFO`    | Control integration verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Suppress Redundant Calls**      | `Off`     | **API Optimization:** Skip API calls when target state matches cached state (temperature, mode, presence, power). Saves quota on accidental double-clicks or UI interactions. Only sends when actual change detected. Values not in cache always send. |
| **Suppress Redundant Buttons**     | `Off`     | **Aggressive Optimization:** Also skip button actions (resume_all, boost_all, turn_off_all, set_mode_all) when ALL zones already match target state. Requires 'Suppress Redundant Calls' to be enabled. Individual explicit actions always send. |

<br>

### Full Cloud Mode (All Generations)

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> **Full Cloud Mode: When to Use It**
>
> Full Cloud Mode creates climate entities via cloud polling instead of HomeKit/Matter integration.
>
> **✅ RECOMMENDED FOR:**
> - **V2 Bridges (GW)** - These lack HomeKit/Matter support, making Full Cloud Mode the **only** option for climate entities
> - V2 bridges have **~20,000 calls/day** which makes cloud polling viable
>
> **⚠️ USE WITH CAUTION:**
> - **V3 Bridges (IB01/GW01)** - Currently 1k calls/day, reducing to 100 soon
> - **Tado X (IB02)** - Currently 1k calls/day, reducing to 100 soon
> - **Recommendation:** Use HomeKit (V3) or Matter (X) integration instead — no API cost, local control
> - Full Cloud Mode is **technically supported** for all generations but **not recommended** for V3/X due to quota limits
>
> **⚠️ API QUOTA IMPACT:**
> - Every temperature change = 1 API call
> - **V2:** ~20k calls/day makes cloud polling sustainable
> - **V3/X:** 1k calls/day (soon: 100) exhausted quickly by temperature changes
> - **Best Practice:** Use HomeKit/Matter for V3/X to preserve quota for advanced features
>
> **Configuration:**
> - Enable during setup: Config Flow → **Full Cloud Mode** toggle

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Schedule Planning Sensors:**
> The `next_schedule_*` sensors provide a peek into the future without extra polling.
> However, during **Away Mode**, Tado often disables the standard schedule, causing these sensors to report `Unknown`. This is normal behavior as there is no active "next block" counting down.

<br>

### Physical Devices (Valves/Thermostats)

<br>

Hardware-specific entities. _These entities are **injected** into your existing HomeKit devices (V3 only). For Tado X, they appear as separate entities (Matter lacks serial numbers for linking)._

<br>

| Entity                      | Type          | Description                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `binary_sensor.battery`     | Binary Sensor | Battery health (Normal/Low).                        |
| `binary_sensor.connection`  | Binary Sensor | Device connectivity to Tado cloud.                  |
| `switch.child_lock`         | Switch        | Toggle Child Lock on the device.                    |
| `switch.dazzle_mode`        | Switch        | **v3 Only:** Control display brightness/behavior.   |
| `number.temperature_offset` | Number        | Interactive temperature calibration (-10 to +10°C). |

| `tado_hijack.boost_all_zones`       | Boost every zone to 25°C.                                                                                                    | **1 call** (bulk)    | **1 call** (bulk)    |
| `tado_hijack.resume_all_schedules`  | Restore Smart Schedule across all zones.                                                                                     | **1 call** (bulk)    | **1 call** (bulk)    |

| `tado_hijack.manual_poll`           | Force immediate data refresh. Use `refresh_type` to control scope. Add `entity_id` for a targeted single-entity fetch (saves quota). | **1-N** (depends)    | **1-N** (depends)    |

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Intelligent Post-Action Polling (`refresh_after`):**
> When active, the integration uses a smart decision engine to save API quota:
>
> - **Immediate Refresh:** Triggered for `auto` (Resume Schedule) or permanent manual changes. Since the target state is reached immediately, an instant GET request confirms the cloud synchronization.
> - **Intelligently Deferred:** For timed modes (`duration`), the refresh is **deferred** until the timer actually expires. Polling immediately during a timer is wasteful; we wait for the "expiry event" to fetch the new post-timer state.
> - **Event-Aware:** For `next_block` or `presence` overlays, immediate polling is suppressed as the cloud state transition depends on external time/events.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Targeting Rooms:** You can use **any** Tado zone entity (climate, switch, sensor) or even **device entities** (battery, connection, child_lock) as the `entity_id`. Device entities automatically resolve to their zone via serial number lookup. This includes your existing **HomeKit climate** entities (e.g. `climate.living_room`).
>
> **Targeted Fetch:** When using `manual_poll` with an `entity_id`, the refresh is limited to that single entity — `offsets` costs 1 API call instead of N, `away` costs 1 instead of M. `capabilities` uses the lazy cache and only drops that zone's entry. Bulk types (`zone`, `metadata`, `presence`, `all`) always fall back to a full refresh.

<br>

### `set_mode` Examples (YAML)

<br>

**Hot Water Boost (30 Min):**

## Known Constraints

<br>

### API Limitations (Tado Backend)

<br>

While Tado Hijack optimizes every possible interaction, some operations are inherently limited by Tado's server-side architecture:

- **No Bulk Device Config:** Tado does **not** provide bulk API endpoints for hardware-specific settings. Temperature Offsets, Child Lock, and Window Detection must be sent individually (1 API call per device). If you change these for 10 devices, it will always cost 10 calls.
- **Schedule Logic is Cloud-Side:** When you "Resume Schedule", the actual target temperature is determined by Tado's servers. To show the correct value in HA immediately, a single confirmatory poll is required (if `Refresh After Resume` is enabled).
- **Sequential Execution:** To prevent account locks and respect the backend, device configuration commands are executed sequentially with a small delay.

<br>

### Hybrid Cloud Dependency

<br>

While Tado Hijack uses the cloud for its power-features, your basic smart home remains resilient:

- **Local Resilience:** Temperature control and heating state via **HomeKit** remain fully functional even during internet outages or Tado server issues.
- **Cloud-Only Features:** Access to Smart Schedules, Hot Water control, and AC-Pro features requires a connection to Tado's servers.
- **Why Cloud?** Tado does not expose a local API for advanced logic. Tado Hijack bridges this gap while keeping your local core intact.

## Troubleshooting

<br>

If you encounter issues, please check the following steps before opening a GitHub issue or asking on Discord.

<br>

### Expert-Level Diagnostics

<br>

Sharing diagnostics **should be safe**. Our built-in Diagnostic Report uses **Multi-Layer Anonymization** to protect your privacy while providing all necessary technical data. However, you should always verify the content yourself before posting it publicly. If in doubt, send the report via DM to an administrator.

- **🔑 Key Pseudonymization:** Home Assistant Entity-IDs in JSON keys are transformed into unique anonymized hashes (e.g. `sensor.entity_8a3f`). This protects your room names while maintaining machine-readability for debugging.
- **🛡️ PII Masking:** All sensitive names (Zones, Homes, Mobile Devices, Titles) are replaced with `"Anonymized Name"`.
- **🕵️‍♂️ Serial Number Protection:** Every hardware identifier (VA, RU, IB, etc.), E-mail address, and cryptographic secret (Tokens, Hashes) is automatically masked via intelligent Regex everywhere in the document.
- **📊 Pure Debug Power:** Despite maximum privacy, the report contains all technical insights needed for support:
  - Detailed Quota & Adaptive Interval math.
  - API Queue & Action status.
  - Internal Entity Mappings (Anonymized but uniquely identifiable).
  - Device Metadata (Firmware, Battery, Connection status).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<br>

### Where are my climate entities and current temperature?

Tado Hijack does **NOT** provide `climate` entities for heating zones. You need **HomeKit Device** (v3) or **Matter** (Tado X) for temperature control.

**Why use local protocols instead of cloud API?**

| Reason | Explanation |
| :----- | :---------- |
| **API Quota** | Accurate temp polling needs 720-1,440 calls/day → quota exhausted. Current limit is 1,000 calls/day. |
| **Speed** | HomeKit/Matter = instant response. Cloud API = latency + polling delays. |
| **Reliability** | Local protocols work offline. Cloud API requires internet. |
| **Cost** | HomeKit/Matter = zero API calls. Cloud API = every action costs quota. |

**What each integration provides:**

| Integration | Temperature Control | Cloud Features | API Calls |
| :---------- | :-----------------: | :------------: | :-------: |
| **HomeKit/Matter** | ✅ (`climate` entities, current temp) | ❌ | 0 |
| **Tado Hijack** | ❌ | ✅ (Schedules, Hot Water, AC Pro, Hardware) | Optimized |

**Setup:** Install HomeKit/Matter first → then Tado Hijack → **V3:** Features get injected into HomeKit devices | **Tado X:** Features appear as separate entities (Matter limitation).

<br>

### Do I need both integrations? Can I use Hijack alone?

**Recommended setup:** Both integrations for complete experience.

**With both (Recommended):**
- ✅ Temperature control (HomeKit/Matter)
- ✅ Cloud features (Tado Hijack)
- ✅ Unified devices (features injected into local entities)

**Hijack only (Limited):**
- ✅ Hot Water (v3) and AC (v3) climate entities via cloud API
- ✅ Schedule controls, hardware devices, device settings
- ❌ No climate entities for regular heating zones
